#  Walmart Store Sales Prediction üõíüí∞
#  Overview
Welcome to the Walmart Store Sales Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting the sales of Walmart stores using various machine learning models. We'll explore a large dataset containing information about Walmart stores and their sales, and then build several models including XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree to predict store sales. We'll evaluate the models based on accuracy levels, F1 scores, and make predictions for future sales.

#  Dataset Columns
. Store: Represents the store number where the sales were recorded. Each store is assigned a unique identifier.

. Date: The date of the recorded sales. It helps track the timing of sales data.

. Year: The year in which the sales were recorded. It provides a temporal dimension to the data.

. WeeklySales: The total sales for the week in the respective store. It is the target variable for prediction.

. HolidayFlag: A binary flag indicating whether the week includes a holiday (1) or not (0). Holidays can impact sales patterns.

. Temperature: The temperature in the region during the week. Weather conditions can affect consumer behavior.

. Fuel_Price: The price of fuel in the region during the week. Fluctuations in fuel prices can influence consumer spending.

. CPI: The Consumer Price Index in the region during the week. CPI reflects changes in the cost of living and can affect purchasing power.

. Unemployment: The unemployment rate in the region during the week. It indicates the economic conditions and can impact consumer confidence and spending habits.

#  Key Objectives
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset to gain insights into store sales patterns, correlations, and trends.
#  Model Building: Implemented the following machine learning models:
. XGBoost
. Logistic Regression
. Support Vector Machine
. Random Forest
. Decision Tree
# Model Evaluation: I Evaluated the performance of each model based on accuracy levels and F1 scores.
# Predictions: Made predictions using the best-performing model to forecast future store sales.
#  Models Implemented
. XGBoost: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and performance.

. Logistic Regression: A classic linear model used for binary classification tasks.

. Support Vector Machine (SVM): A versatile algorithm suitable for both classification and regression tasks.

. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions.

. Decision Tree: A simple yet effective model that makes decisions based on feature splits.

# Evaluation Metrics

. Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified instances.

. F1 Score: A measure of a model's accuracy that considers both precision and recall.

#  Predictions
Using the best-performing model, we made predictions for future store sales based on the dataset's features.
